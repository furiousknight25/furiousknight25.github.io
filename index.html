		<p><em>(reading time: few seconds to check if its working)</em></p>
        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>When the average person thinks of programming, they often get the message that only smart math people can do it and that it takes a degree or some 
            prodigy talent.
        </p>
        <p>If you solve the problem 1 + x = 2 then you are ready to program. People often say you can just use google to learn how to program, but with 
            so many options and routes to take to learn its extremely daunting for a new person to start. 
        </p>
        <p>This is one of the main reasons why I wanted to teach a few of my peers how to program in 3 6-8 hour long lessons. </p>
        <p>The first objection that comes to mind is that, "doesn't programming take years to learn? Isn't theres a reason why colleges have programs
            to teach computer science?" And yes, it can take years to be good at programming fast, but if you want to start creating whatever you want, you
            only need a few concepts to be taught within a few hours.
        </p>
        <p>I believed that within 2 days I could teach my peers how to understand the basic concept of this chunk of code <img src="assets/program.png"></p>
        <p>There was 3 main things that I wanted to do, teach them the basic concepts in programming, teach them how to google, and to get them inspired to create their own ideas(the last one failed misserably)</p>
        <h1>Teaching</h1>
        <p>Teaching my peers was a unique challenge in itself, for one i've never really taught anything like this and 2 these were my <em>peers.</em> 
            Normally it would not seem like an issue but there this means I don't have the authority or credibility as a computer science teacher(not saying I am as good as a cs teacher).
            This just means since my peers are not in a school enviornment I could not give them the motivation to learn with grades or teacher authority. 
        </p>
        <p>But heres day 1 <br><img src="assets/classroom.png"><br> <sub><i>(note, depicted with no face as my emotion was in a constant feeling of desparation to cram knowledge.)</i></sub></p>
        <p>It took me a while to decide on what to start teaching first, programming is technically an infintely complex field but I wanted to show my 
            peers what the core of what programming is right away. This is why I started the lesson by saying that there is only 3 things to know in programming.
        </p>
        <p> If statements, Functions, and Variables</p>
        <p>Explaining what they are is out of the scope of this paper but they are 3 big concepts in the rabit hole that is computer science. 
            And if im gonna be honest, while its not completly false, this is just a definition of program that I created.
        </p>
        <p> The benefit to this is that one these three things can get them infinitely far and two it prevents cognitive overload. Cognitive overload is the natural
            capacity of our short term memory to learn around 4 -+ 1 things at once.
        </p>
        <p>After this it was on the inevietble and daunting task of actually teaching the boring part of programming, the syntax. This is the same as teaching 
            grammer in english. No one wants to learn it so how do you make it entertaining?
        </p>
        <p>Well it turns out there is not many options around it, humans tend to learn new concepts through passive and dry learning, aka word for word 
            definitions and memorizations. This relates back to the idea of cognitive load, a student can't start writing a novel without learning how to 
            structure a word and sentance first. 
        </p>
        <p>But I still wanted to actually have some kind of active learning, if my peers come to my "class" to learn how to program they would hate me 
            if I sat them down to type programming structure and definitions. I needed to get them in software ASAP, to make them feel the joy of creating their own software.
        </p>
        <p>My solution to this was block coding. Block coding has a sour taste in a lot of people's mouth as it has been taught to be programming for babies in elementary school.
            But it only has this conotation because of the way that it is taught and shown, I wanted to show that it can be just as hard as the real deal. 
        </p>
