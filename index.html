        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>When the average person thinks of programming, they often get the message that only smart math people can do it and that it takes a degree or some 
            prodigy talent.
        </p>
        <p>If you solve the problem 1 + x = 2 then you are ready to program. People often say you can just use google to learn how to program, but with 
            so many options and routes to take to learn its extremely daunting for a new person to start. 
        </p>
        <p>This is one of the main reasons why I wanted to teach a few of my peers how to program in 3 6-8 hour long lessons. </p>
        <p>The first objection that comes to mind is that, "doesn't programming take years to learn? Isn't theres a reason why colleges have programs
            to teach computer science?" And yes, it can take years to be good at programming fast, but if you want to start creating whatever you want, you
            only need a few concepts to be taught within a few hours.
        </p>
        <p>I believed that within 2 days I could teach my peers how to understand the basic concept of this chunk of code <img src="assets/program.png"></p>
        <p>There was 3 main things that I wanted to do, teach them the basic concepts in programming, teach them how to google, and to get them inspired to create their own ideas(the last one failed misserably)</p>
        <h1>Day One</h1>
        <p>Teaching my peers was a unique challenge in itself, for one i've never really taught anything like this and 2 these were my <em>peers.</em> 
            Normally it would not seem like an issue but there this means I don't have the authority or credibility as a computer science teacher(not saying I am as good as a cs teacher).
            This just means since my peers are not in a school enviornment I could not give them the motivation to learn with grades or teacher authority. 
        </p>
        <p>But heres day 1 <br><img src="assets/classroom.png"></p>
        <p>It took me a while to decide on what to start teaching first, programming is technically an infintely complex field but I wanted to show my 
            peers what the core of what programming is right away. This is why I started the lesson by saying that there is only 3 things to know in programming.
        </p>
        <p> If statements, Functions, and Variables</p>
        <p>Explaining what they are is out of the scope of this paper but they are 3 big concepts in the rabit hole that is computer science. 
            And if im gonna be honest, while its not completly false, this is just a definition of program that I created.
        </p>
        <p> The benefit to this is that one these three things can get them infinitely far and two it prevents cognitive overload. Cognitive overload is the natural
            capacity of our short term memory to learn around 4 -+ 1 things at once.
        </p>
        <p>After this it was on the inevietble and daunting task of actually teaching the boring part of programming, the syntax. This is the same as teaching 
            grammer in english. No one wants to learn it so how do you make it entertaining?
        </p>
        <p>Well it turns out there is not many options around it, humans tend to learn new concepts through passive and dry learning, aka word for word 
            definitions and memorizations. This relates back to the idea of cognitive load, a student can't start writing a novel without learning how to 
            structure a word and sentance first. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Here is the predicament though, it is possible to teach the dry topics in an interesting way by sacraficing speed.
            According to the young modulus graph students learn best when stress levels are kept at a sweet spot.
            For a difficult task, they can perform well if its made to be entertaining. <img src="assets/yerke.png">
            <br><sub><small>Arousal can also mean stress level*</small></sub>
        </p>

        <p>
            The solution to making difficult tasks interesting was Multimodal explanations. While they aren't the greatest at Teaching
            dry topics like syntax, they can certainly help ease students into a topic by having them interact and see concepts in new perspectives.
        </p>
        <p>One option of multimodal explanations that I wanted to include were interactives. Because, if my peers came all the way to my house to learn programming, they expect to actually do things,
            not to just sit there while i list off facts about syntax.
        </p>
        <p>this is a perfect example of the style of teaching that couldve happened(INSTER HERE)</p>
        <p> Interactives are active learning, and active learning is fun.</p>
        <p>Now didn't wasn't the claim boring dry topics can only be taught through passive learning? And yes thats true, but by using interactives, you can 
            slowly sprinkle in passive learning topics throughout the process <em>tricking</em> the student into accidently learning the boring topic. In reality, programmers can 
            often accidently learn things like code orginaztion on accident while actively learning how to create a video game.
        </p>
        <p>Okay now to reveal what I chose as my multimodal interactive. Block coding. </p>
        <p>There was one big flaw with this though, this multimodal distracted from the content that was meant to be taught. 
            Often students would get stuck focusing on how to use the software itself before they could actually invision their program. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Going back to ther yerkesdodson graph, this is where they were <img src="assets/dot.png">
        </p>
        <p>In the end, this is why choosing the medium for learning can be extremly important. But it could've been worse, if my peers started out typing programs in script the learning curve would be even higher.</p>
        <p>Although i tried my best to reduce this to the best of my extent given the time. Here are some general guidelines to follow when creating multimodal interactives to reduce cognitive overload.
            <ol>
                <li>Don't teach the student how to use the software, instead create preset projects in the software that students can interact with. Ex.(if teaching a student how to cut clips together in a video editing software, have preset videos in the timeline that need  to be cut)</li>
                <li>Have examples for students to reference, even an answer key can work. This allows students to feel less stressed about going the wrong way and gives instant feedback to learn from.</li>
            
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>If there was a perfect solution, it would be to create a multimodal interactive thats charming, simple and fun. The issue with this is that it takes time and skill to create. So the 2nd best option is to 
            use interactable tools that relate to the topic that is being taught.
        </p>
        <p>All in all, day one got the main message across, and suprisgnly students even remembered some of the details.  
            <img src="assets/dayoneresults.png" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>on top of this day almost perfectly hit the sweet spot. 
            The goal was to not have them always know what to do, nor should they have been completely clueless. 
            So staying in the yellow zone here fits yerkesdodson's graph quite well.
            <img src="assets/dayonefeeling.png" alt="">
        </p>
        <h1>Day 2</h1>
        <p>Like mentioned earlier, the goal was to get my peers to understand how to read written code in 2 days.
            I didn't neccecarily think I could get them to be good at programming, but I needed them to know how to teach themself.
        </p>
        <p>
            Day 2 consisted of teaching the same exact thing as last time but in a new perspective, rather than writing in block code they would move into 
            actual written code. This was once again intimidating as they had to learn a completely new software again while learning how to write code at the same time.
        </p>
        <p>This time around it was about the same thing, lots of pre made projects and puzzles made for my peers to go through. 
            each one focused on a specific concept in programming so they can experience a usefulness to programming.    
        </p>

        <p>
            There was one major difference between this course and the last one though. Near the encoding we 
            did something different and unplanned. We decided to go back to the original chunk of code that seemed to be 
            impossibly complex. <img src="assets/program.png" alt="">
        </p>
        <p>Rather than just spitting out what this code did, with a definite answer in mind I simply asked
            my peers to infer about what this is. And even though they never leared what the code did specifically
            they understood that all they need to know was variables, functions and if statements.
        </p>
        <p>The magic in this is that it gave them confidence to actually start having a <b>disccusion.</b></p>
        <p>Sure by the end of the discussion they didn't fully understand what the code was, and to be honest even i didn't full understand what I wrote in that code. 
            But the point is, they started to use critical thinking to think of their own interpretations.
            Which in the end when I defined programming, logical thinking is what programming is all about.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is honestly something that I wish I have done more earlier, but this'll be talked about more in day 3.
        </p>
        <h1>Day 3</h1>
        <p>Day 3 was a catastrophe and was one of the worst days of my entire life.</p>
        <p>It was supposed to be a final hurrah, the lesson that kick starts my peers into the coding world. I spent dozens of hours on creating this course just to add up to this.</p>
        <p>The main goal for day 3 was</p>
