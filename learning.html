        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>For most of my young childhood I had the side dream of creating video games. If playing video games
            was fun, surely learning how to program would be equally fun. Luckily for me, my basic computer learning class in elementary school
            gave me the oppurtunity to learn and create games, I was just waiting to create all sorts of fun ideas. 
        </p>
        <p>This excitement was crushed <em>instantly.</em></p>
        <p>According to the block coding tutorial, coding was this. <img src="assets/moveright.png"></p>
        <p>In the eyes of a 7 year old, programming was shown to just be random ways to add numbers together,
            how to check if one number was greather than another, or checking if someone presses a button.
        </p>
        <p>As you would expect I gave up on the dream as it was too boring.</a></p>
        <p>The time is now middle school 7th grade, I've had a basic foundation in how to google and figure things out myself. 
            I recently found that lots of game developers online manage to learn programming themself, so naturally I decided that 
            maybe the real programming is by using the big official tools like the unity game engine to create.
        </p>

        <p> With this new found excitement I bought a course online to create a video game and chipped away at it over the course of a year.</p>
        <p>This time, I learned that actually programming is nearly impossible for anyone to learn and I would need a degree in computer science to 
            truly know how to program. 
        </p>
        <p>Throughout the course, the extent of creating a game involved me watching the video for 5 seconds, then
            copying down the code that the person played not knowing what I was doing at all. By the end of the 
            course I succesfully created a <a href="https://simmer.io/@Furiousk/project-1-3rd-edition" target="_blank">game</a> without knowing what anything said or meant in my code. It was the 
            opposite of my original experience in programming. <img src="assets/game.png">
        </p>
        <p>Once again I gave up on this hope of creating my own game.</p>
        <p>My final experience in starting programming </p>
